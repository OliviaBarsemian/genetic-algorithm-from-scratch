# genetic-algorithm-from-scratch

Python genetic algorithm evolving DNA sequences toward a target motif.

--> Enter a population size when prompted. Watch the best sequence improve generation by generation.

How it works:

1. Initialize a population of random characters.
2. Evaluate each sequence’s fitness against the target motif (DNA sequences).
3. Select parent sequences proportionally to fitness.
4. Apply crossover and mutation to generate the next generation.
5. Repeat until a sequence matches the target or convergence is reached.
